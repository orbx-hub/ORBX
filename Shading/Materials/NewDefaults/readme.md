A set of improved defaults of the base Octane materials. Materials include:
* Improved Octane's Diffuse Material
* Improved Octane's Glossy Material
* Improved Octane's Specular Material
and more.

Mainly consisting of switching all materials to "GGX energy preserving", a middle-gray value as the "base color" and material layer method for coat on single-lobe materials such as the Diffuse Material, or Specular (the material layer reflection becomes independant from the specular roughness, the coat can be made rough while the refraction "clear, see-through".
