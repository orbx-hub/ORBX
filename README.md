# OctaneRender® ORBX File Repository

skientia.co ORBX file reposity

## Overview

The ORBX file reposity is an easy way to quickly access, copy and paste modified Octane's items / objects or "nodes", in other words, custom presets.
Two approaches to this workflow:
1. Copy of the raw code, for instance, to direcly paste in Octane Standalone
2. Download of the .orbx file for a direct copy into the ORBX folder default directory known as the "LocalDb".

| Category | Description |
| :---   | :---   |
| `Lights` | for improved light sampling, substentially increased efficiency and groups for creative filters |
| `Kernels` | for various situations e.g. faster, low preview sampling to particular cases such as caustics |
| `Materials` | from fully procedural textures to material-groups for more complex surfaces |
| `Project files` | complete data set, including geometry assets, textures ("painted"), camerass, and more |



### System Requirements
Recommended version: `Octane 2024` (Standalone or plug-in) and onwards.
Cross-platform
> [!NOTE]
> OctaneRender® is available for free via the free tier, e.g. Octane for Blender.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Plug-in users must refer to the dedcated Octane [plug-in host] documentation for ORBX import information.

### About ORBX
> OTOY releases OctaneRender™ 1.5 and introduces .ORBX (20, 2014) 
The new .ORBX file format improves considerably on traditional 3D formats such as .OBJ, .CAD, or .STL, going beyond storing simple geometry to include all aspects of a 3D scene, such as materials, properties, textures, lighting, transform hierarchies and cameras, all in a self-contained file format. Unlike the Alembic file format, .ORBX was designed in close collaboration with Autodesk and Mozilla to be a flexible container for a wide range of uses beyond computer graphics, including video, 3D printing, holography, design and engineering. 
>
> The .ORBX format allows for incredible granularity, supporting the modeling of physical properties of a scene or object down to two hundredths of a nanometer, or a quarter of the size of a hydrogen atom. OctaneRender™ 1.5 and related plugins allow artists and animators to perfectly import and export extraordinarily complex 3D scenes in .ORBX format across 15 modeling programs, appearing in the same final render quality as the program they were originally created in. The flexibility of the .ORBX format has implications for media and entertainment companies who can now effectively use their computer-generated assets and IP across a variety of mediums, from feature film and television development, to video games, web sites, and toy production for example.
